# OPUS 4 Installation Testing

This repository currently still contains the old installation and update code for OPUS 4. This is no longer used. 

We are currently working on using this repository for installation and update tests of the new OPUS 4 
installation and update process. The scripts used for installation might be moved here from the application
repository at some point in the future.
